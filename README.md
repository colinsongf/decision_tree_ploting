# Decision Tree Plotting
I made this because I wanted to be able to plot decision trees from sklearn with tools like matplotlib and bokeh. 


## Vocabulary
In the code I refer to right distance and left distance of a node. The right distance is how far out to the right the children of a node extend. These measures are used to help determine where to place a node so its branches do not overlap.
